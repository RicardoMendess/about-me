about me

Hi, I've been a software developer since 2021 and have been building solutions with Javascript and Typescript.

I currently work as a senior front-end software engineer at Accenture, as an Angular specialist, working in a banking sector that impacts millions of users.

In the projects I worked on, I always aimed to ensure accessibility, efficiency and security, improving performance, optimizing applications and allowing the user to have the best final experience.

In my free time, I have the pleasure of helping out in the community, helping other developers who are starting out.

If you have any questions or want to exchange an idea, feel free, I will be happy to help!
